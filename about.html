					<h2>About Me</h2>
					My name is Edward Truong.  I'm currently a second year student at the University of Waterloo, studying Computer Science.
					<br><br>
					During my spare time when I'm not busy with studies, I enjoy working on little projects here and there.
					Some of these projects were websites, content management systems, games, and scripts.
					Unfortunately, it was only recently that I decided to open a GitHub account to start tracking my progress.
					At first, I was working on designing websites using HTML and CSS with the addition of Twitter Bootstrap.<br><br>
					Soon after finishing one of my flat design projects, I jumped straight into game development.
					Knowing that there is a work needed to even begin programming, I decided to develop ontop of an already existing developing framework.
					So, I decided to use LibGDX, mainly for the fact that you can develop for the PC and easily deploy your project to other platforms such as the web or Android.
					As the days flew by, I continued to learn more and more about game development and game design.  I spent a lot of the time not only programming, but also designing pixel art for my game.
					Since the game is not near completion, I still plan on continuing the project as much as I can during my school term.
					Overall, this project has taught me a lot about the hardships that come with working on large projects.
					<br><br>
					That's all for now.  Look forward to more projects in the future!
